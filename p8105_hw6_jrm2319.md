Homework 6: Linear Models
================

## Problem 2

### Part A: Create a city_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved

### Part B: For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the glm function to fit a logistic regression with resolved vs unresolved as the outcome and victim age, sex and race as predictors

### Part C: Run glm for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract the adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims.

### Part D: Create a plot that shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each city. Organize cities according to estimated OR, and comment on the plot.

## Problem 3

### Part A: Load and clean the data for regression analysis (i.e. convert numeric to factor where appropriate, check for missing data, etc.).

### Part B: Propose a regression model for birthweight.

#### Part B.2: Describe your modeling process and show a plot of model residuals against fitted values – use add_predictions and add_residuals in making this plot.

### Part C: Compare your model to two others

#### Part C.2: One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main effects only)

#### Part C.3: One using head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions (including the three-way interaction) between these
